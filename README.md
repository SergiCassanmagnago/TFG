This Repository gathers the code used for the implementation of my Thesis in Bachelor Degree in Informatics Engineering at [UPC](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering) as well as the obtained results. This Thesis consists on
a benchmarking of the continuous behavior of stream processing techniques on the problem of enumerating weakly connected components.

In this work, as a proof of concept, we conduct a comparative study of the continuous behavior of two stream processing-based solutions for the previously mentioned problem. The first of the two approaches corresponds to the Dynamic Pipeline Paradigm, which is a Paradigm that has been recently proposed as an approach to address SP, and it is currently still restricted to the academical environment. It is inherently incremental, and it requires support for parallelization and communication between processes. Because of this, the Golang programming language was chosen for its implementation, since it offers native support for parallelization with its goroutines and communication between processes with its channels.

Because of its support for both stream and batch processing, the Apache Flink Framework was chosen as the second approach to be used in this benchmarking. Given that an initial objective of this study was to be able to expand to cover both techniques in case there was time availability, using Flink gave us the ability to potentially cover both techniques with the same tool. This approach was implemented using the DataSet API and the Java programming langhage.

Regarding the benchmarking between the two previously mentioned approaches we selected the following graphs from the [Stanford DataSet Collection](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/):

The reason for selecting these particular datasets was to test both approaches in large complex and undirected graphs, with different amounts of nodes, edges, diameters and average clustering coefficients as shown in the table. All graphs have been executed in a machine with an x86 architecture with 64 bits, an Intel Core i7 processor with 4 cores and 8 threads @ 1.80 GHz. When it comes to software, the Dynamic Pipeline Paradigm solution has been implemented using golang 1.19.2, and the Apache Flink Framework solution has been implemented using Java version 11.0.7 and Apache Flink version 1.16.0.

To assess the incremental delivery of results, we used the [diefpy](https://sdm-tib.github.io/diefpy/introduction.html#) library, which is a python library used for measuring the incremental efficiency of different implementations. This library receives answer traces, which are files containing, for each of the produced results, the test that has been used along with the used approach, the answer number and the elapsed time for each particular answer. It provides useful plots for comparing the total execution time of different executions, as well as the time in which each answer has been generated. It also allows measuring diefficiency metrics, i.e., the continuous efficiency of each implementation for generating incremental results along with other metrics.
